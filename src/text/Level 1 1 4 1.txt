Why am I staring at a wall?
You ever feel like you hit a wall and don't know/what to do?
Well, yeah, that's me right now. I've hit a wall/in this project and I have no idea where to go.
However, that's what we have partners for. A/good partner is a lot better than a good brain./At least that's my opinion.
By the way, why are you in here? You look/underage.
