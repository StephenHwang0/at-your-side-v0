I love my husband!
I love him so much, it hurts a little when he/goes to sea...
But that's okay, because he likes it and I want/him to be happy!

A bone? Yeah, you can have one. Just tell the/butcher that I said it's okay.
Oh, but first could you do me a favour? My son/is at the park, could you check on him and see/if he's alright?

Oh good, he's still at the park. He's a little/wild, so sometimes I worry about him.
Sometimes I'm afraid that he'll wander off, so I/want to make sure I keep him close when I can.
My husband called the butcher for you, so you can/go and pick it up now. Thanks for helping me out!
Keep those who you care about close to you too,/alright?
