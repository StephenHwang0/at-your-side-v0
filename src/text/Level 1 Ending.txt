It’s important to recognize when a friend is in/trouble. How do you tell? Well, there are many/different possible clues.
According the the New York State Police, common/signs of an issue are a marked personality/change, withdrawal from usual activities…
…a neglect for appearance, and an inability to/concentrate. Some may begin to commit petty/crimes as a way of escape.
It’s possible that they’re just in a bad mood, but/signs like these shouldn’t be ignored. It’s/better to be safe than sorry...
...so make sure you talk to them. Even if they’re/just having an off day, they’ll be glad to have/someone there for them.
