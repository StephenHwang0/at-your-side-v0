Huh? Ms. Flores sent you? Alright.
You see, I lost my other broom somewhere, and I/really need it or I won’t be able to go home.
I honestly forgot where I left it, but I’ve looked/through the halls already, so it’s probably in a/room.
If you find it, come back here and let me know./Thanks so much!

It was in the washroom?!? Wow. I’m really sorry,/I should’ve thought of that.
You look like you still have something to do. I/won’t keep you any longer. 
Thanks for taking some time to help, kid. You were/a real help.
You go tell Ms. Flores that, too. Earn some cookie/points.
