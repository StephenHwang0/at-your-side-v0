Hey, Pro. You look a little tired.

Ah, he’s alright. He’s been having some trouble/adjusting to this school.
Now, I know your looking for Mara, but before I/tell you where she is, you’ll have to listen to/me talk for a bit.
As you probably know, Mara’s been going through/some hard times.
Once the school found out about her recent/activities, she was almost suspended, but because/of her circumstances, she was excused.
I allow her to stay after school so she can be/alone, which she needs, especially with her home/being a wreck at the moment.
If you go, I want you to promise me one thing./Promise me that you’ll be there for her, and not/yourself.
Right now, she doesn’t want to be pestered for/information or given advice.
All she wants is a listening ear, a shoulder to/cry on. Nothing more, nothing less.
…
Mara’s in the classroom beside the girl's/washroom. She asked me to tell you where she is.
She’s blessed to have a friend like you, Pro. But/try to bless her a little more, okay?
