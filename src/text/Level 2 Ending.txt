According to a recent study, approximately 50% of/all North American children will experience their/parents’ divorce.
While this may seem like a huge number, it is/only the tip of the iceberg.
There are many more issues that aren’t family/related, and most teens will go through at least/one major problem during their adolescent years.
That’s why it’s important to learn how to not only/spot your friends’ troubles, but also to help them/cope with whatever they may be going through.
Sometimes friends look for your opinions and/advice, but there are times when they just need/someone to talk to.
It may take effort, and it may take time, but your/friend will be grateful that you’re simply there/for them...
...not to offer judgement or criticism, but just/as a shoulder to lean on.
Don’t worry if they don’t open up to you/immediately, as some things can be hard to say.
Take comfort in knowing that they know you’re/their friend. They’ll talk to you when the time/comes.
