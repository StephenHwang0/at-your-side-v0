Hello, and welcome to Center Park!

Has a mother come by here looking for her child?/I don’t think so…
There was someone though. He came in here and/asked if a kid came in here, and then left.
He just went outside. Maybe it was the father?

Oh, hello. I supposed that wasn’t the person you/were looking for?
Well, someone came just came in and asked me if/her daughter came here today. A girl with pink/hair.
To be honest, it was kind of weird. After I said/no, she said she’d be in the area with the picnic/tables and left.
Maybe you should go and talk to her.
