Children in broken families are at risk/psychologically, and again, this is only the tip/of the iceberg.
When going through a difficult time, many teens/don’t know who to turn to or who to go to. What/better way to show support as a friend?
Friends stay together through good times and bad,/through happiness and adversity.
Loving relationships with friends and family are/very much worth keeping, as these people can/stick with you through thick and thin.
Help your friends get to the root of their/difficulties, as problems will never go away/otherwise, and more times than not...
...you’ll come to a happy resolution.
